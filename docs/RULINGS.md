# Rulings — glibe

The decisions that bind the code. Each is quoted where it came from, dated,
and given the place it landed. A ruling without a landing is a wish; this file
records only the ones that reached the code.

### R1 — *"a structure doesn't have an end_bar unless it is ended"* — user, 2026-10-03

A leaf or branch that has not ended carries **no** `end_bar`, and no `exit_bar`.
Both are `Option`. The alternative — a sentinel bar of zeros — lies, and its
`idx` of `0` collides with the first real bar's `idx`, which is also `0`.

**Landed in:** `leaf.gleam:26-27` (`end_bar: Option(DataBar)`), `branch.gleam:47-48`
(`end_bar` / `exit_bar: Option(DataBar)`), and `timeframe.gleam:34,43-57`
(`working_databar`, the four twins, and `manual_enter` / `manual_exit` all
`Option`). The per-bar rewrite of a sentinel and the false size it produced are
gone.

---

### R2 — *"branches are conceptually a group of leaves"* — user, 2026-10-03

A branch is not a move drawn separately from the leaves; a `YangBranch` rides
yin leaves and a `YinBranch` rides yang leaves. The interesting part is the
group, and a branch dies when the leaf it rides has lived too long.

**Landed in:** `branch.gleam` `next_yang_branch` / `next_yin_branch` — recognition
and death are expressed entirely in terms of the riding leaf.

---

### R3 — *"CMA 当然同样是选定均线的均值呀"* — user, 2026-09-15

The leaf CMA averages the **selected SMA** (`sma_tiny`), not the price. Feeding
it `close` is a prior error (mimo's). It is the forward recurrence
`(cma_old × N_old + raw) / (N_old + 1)` with `N_old = idx − start_idx`, one step
instead of a walk.

**Landed in:** `leaf.gleam:163` `leaf_cma`. A leaf born this bar returns its own
`sma_tiny`, never `0.0`.

---

### R4 — *"think of it again, you seem to only need a line of code"* — user, 2026-10-03

Recognition is one line: a `YangBranch` is recognised when `growing_yang_branch`
is `None` **and** `working_databar.idx == growing_yin_leaf.start_bar.idx`.

**Landed in:** `engine.gleam:158-159` (`yin_recognised` / `yang_recognised`). The
just-settled leaf (`previous`) is passed only to backtrack `start_bar` to the
dead leaf's corner; it gates nothing.

---

### R5 — *"since it has been dead for a while, it is not the death bar"* — user, 2026-10-03

`exit_bar` is `branch_exit_leaf_size` bars **after** the death, never the death
bar. A structure found dead after a long time is recognised as dead late.

**Landed in:** `branch.gleam` `next_*_branch` — `exit_bar = Some(databar)` on the
bar the branch is recognised as dead, `end_bar = Some(leaf.leaf_start_bar(riding))`
(the start of the leaf that killed it).

---

### R6 — closing is a length test, never a price test

A branch ends when the riding leaf has lived `branch_exit_leaf_size` bars — `>=`,
not `>` (the off-by-one in the original). Price never decides a close.

**Landed in:** `branch.gleam:196,238` (`leaf.data_leaf_size(riding, databar) >= exit_size`).

---

### R7 — *"a principle without a mechanism is decoration"* — design law

A rule that cannot be checked will be broken. The module-purity rule is a script,
not a paragraph.

**Landed in:** `scripts/no_timeframe_mixture.sh` — fails the build if `timeframe.gleam`
declares any function but `new`, or if any module but `timeframe.gleam` declares
`pub type Timeframe`.

---

### R8 — reject, never repair — glib's recorded decision, adopted 2026-10-04

A source bar whose own numbers disagree is rejected with the reason. It is not
repaired into agreement, because a repair puts a number in the engine no exchange
sent, and every indicator downstream is then measured on it.

**Landed in:** `api/sourcebar.gleam:62` `validate` (high ≥ low ≥ 0, volume ≥ 0,
high the highest of the four, low the lowest).

---

### R9 — convert epoch-ms at the boundary, not inside the bucket test

An exchange that counts milliseconds since the epoch is translated at the ingest
boundary, so every step downstream reads `"2024-01-15 09:00:00"` and not
`"1705309200000"`. Converting inside the bucket test would be the same bug twice.

**Landed in:** `api/sourcebar.gleam:90` `normalize_date` → `api/interval.gleam:82`
`bucket_ends` reads ISO only. This is the fix for the three-round H1 bug: an
hourly timeframe never closed a bar on Binance data.

---

### R10 — a verdict belongs to whoever decides

The `DataBar` carries measurements, nothing else. It used to hold six boolean
verdicts no module wrote; they are gone. A strategy derives its verdict from the
measurements and owns it.

**Landed in:** `databar.gleam` dropped the 15 unwritten fields; `trading/strategy.gleam:26`
`manual_signal` writes `"buy"` / `"sell"` / `""` on the bar.

---

### R11 — the manual strategy judges nothing of its own — user, UC-62

The branch `enter_bar` and `exit_bar` **are** the manual enter and exit. No other
manual strategy is needed for now; trading the opposite polarity too would be a
**second** strategy (shorting the down-leg), which UC-62 rules out.

**Landed in:** `engine.gleam:203` `strategy` — `manual_enter` on recognition,
`manual_exit` on the recognised-as-dead bar; the word written is the `YangBranch`'s.
